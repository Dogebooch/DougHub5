## Job Statements (mapped to flow)

1. **Step 1-2:** "When I miss a board question, I want to capture it instantly without deciding where it goes."

2. **Step 3:** "When processing my inbox, I want to see my weak topics so I know what matters."

3. **Step 4-5:** "When creating cards, I want AI to suggest format and validate quality so I don't create junk."

4. **Step 6:** "When reviewing, I want zero grading decisions—just content recall."

## Frustration Triggers

- Tool becomes friction → closes app
- Silent failures → loses trust
- Grading buttons → decision paralysis
- Can't find context → skips card

## Design Implications

- Default to inbox (defer organization)
- Board Relevance Panel (surface weak topics)
- Card Worthiness Gate (prevent junk, show reasoning)
- FSRS auto-grading (zero decisions in review)
- Support keyboard shortcuts
- AI suggestions reviewed individually (no batch-approve)
