# DougHub User Profile

## Identity
- **Name:** Doug
- **Role:** IM/EM resident with ADHD studying for licensing boards
- **One-liner:** Craves systematic learning but drowns in organizational overhead, especially when cognitively depleted post-shift.

## Context
- **When:** Days off, post-shift, between clinical responsibilities (3-4 hour windows, 1-2 hours usable focus)
- **Where:** Desktop at home (mobile deferred)
- **State:** Decision-fatigued, mentally exhausted, zero tolerance for admin work
- **Session pattern:** Dives in immediately, hates documentation, forgets available features
- **Frustration response:** Closes app when tool becomes friction source

## Dual Intent
- **Board-prep facts:** High-yield content for Step 2/3, practice questions
- **Clinical practice pearls:** Bedside applicable knowledge, clinical reasoning

## Technical Comfort
- **Comfortable:** Keyboard shortcuts, desktop apps, Anki (despite frustrations)
- **Uncomfortable:** Complex configuration, CLI, debugging, manual validation
- **Critical:** Auto-validation—Doug dives in without checking if things work
- **Errors:** Needs hard stops and obvious messages, never silent failures

## Mental States: Capture vs Review

| Aspect | Capture Mode | Review Mode |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **State** | Learning, curious, building | Task completion, getting through queue |
| **Patience** | High—wants perfection | Low—zero tolerance for editing |
| **Goal** | Understand, create perfect cards | Complete reviews efficiently |
| **AI Tolerance** | Welcomes suggestions | Zero interruptions or decisions |
| **Time** | Will invest in getting it right | Wants to finish quickly |

## Frustrations & Pain Points
- **Decision paralysis:** 10+ min lost per session on "Where does this go?"
- **Tool fragmentation:** Can't find cards, can't update related cards together
- **Pattern-matching cards:** Tests recognition of format, not medical knowledge
- **List contamination:** Reviewing one missed differential reveals all answers
- **Scheduling friction:** Zero tolerance for Easy/Medium/Hard grading decisions

## Card Anxiety
- Anxious about creating low-yield cards that won't help
- Wants AI gatekeeping via card-worthiness evaluation
- Prefers curation over volume

## AI Interaction Preferences
- Welcomes suggestions but reviews each individually (no batch-approve)
- Wants reasoning transparency (why this format? why this connection?)
- Wrong suggestions are very annoying—accuracy over speed
- Must enforce evidence-based flashcard practices

## Core Conflict
Doug needs systematic structure to retain medical knowledge, but organizational structure creates the decision points that prevent starting sessions when depleted. He needs clinical reasoning for boards and bedside, but traditional flashcards test rote memorization.

## Job Statements
1. **Primary:** "When I identify key concepts in practice questions, I want to capture and connect them without deciding where they go, so I can build clinical reasoning instead of managing tools."

2. **Exhaustion escape:** "When I'm too tired to process information properly, I want to save it quickly without decisions, so I can deal with it when fresh."

3. **Review efficiency:** "When reviewing flashcards, I want zero scheduling decisions so I can focus entirely on medical content."
