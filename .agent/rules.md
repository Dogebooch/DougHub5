# Workspace Rules for DougHub

- **Visual Communication Priority**: Prefer screenshots over words when describing implementations or fixing issues. "Show, don't just tell" is the standard for technical walkthroughs.
- **Implementation Proof**: When showing a fix or a new feature, provide visual evidence (screenshots or screen recordings) alongside the code explanation.
