# Workspace Rules for DougHub

- **Capture Hub, Not Learning App**: DougHub captures and preprocesses board questions. It does NOT handle flashcard review or spaced repetition — Remnote handles that. See `docs/PHILOSOPHY.md` for details.

- **Visual Communication Priority**: Prefer screenshots over words when describing implementations or fixing issues. "Show, don't just tell" is the standard for technical walkthroughs.

- **Implementation Proof**: When showing a fix or a new feature, provide visual evidence (screenshots or screen recordings) alongside the code explanation.
