1. When backend code is designed or edited, update the logic section under the Developer notepad (see below for rules)
2. When writing in the Developer pane, summarize and use language a non-programmer can understand
3. Only update the pane when editing or changing the backend logic
4. Focus on: capture pipeline, AI client (Ollama), export formatting
5. Do not edit the user's comments
6. Keep the ToDo list up to date in the pane whenever possible

Note: DougHub no longer handles flashcard review or spaced repetition. Backend logic should focus on capture, AI analysis, and export to Remnote.
