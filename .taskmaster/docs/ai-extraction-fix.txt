# MVP Task: Fix AI Extraction Pipeline

## Task: Debug and Fix Ollama AI Extraction
The AI extraction feature is connected to Ollama but needs troubleshooting. Current issues:
- Extraction function may not be returning properly formatted responses
- Need to verify Ollama model compatibility (currently using 7b-instruct)
- Debug logging was added but root cause not yet identified
- extractConcepts() may have JSON parsing issues with Ollama responses

Work needed:
1. Review ai-service.ts extraction functions
2. Test with various Ollama models to find best fit
3. Fix JSON parsing/response handling
4. Verify concept extraction returns valid ExtractedConcept[]
5. Test end-to-end from CaptureInterface paste → AI extraction → concept display

This is MVP-blocking - extraction is core to the capture workflow.
Priority: high
