# Post-MVP UI Enhancements

These are polish features for after MVP is complete. They improve user experience but are not required for core functionality.

## Task 1: Superhuman-style split view for Notebook
Implement a master-detail layout for the Notebook view where the topic list is narrow on the left (approximately 280px) and content displays on the right. This avoids full-page navigation and allows users to quickly scan topics while viewing content. Should include:
- Resizable divider between panes
- Topic list with search/filter
- Smooth transitions when selecting topics
- Keyboard navigation between list and detail pane

## Task 2: Notion-style breadcrumb navigation
Add a breadcrumb trail in the content area header showing current location like "Capture > New Note" or "Review > Cardiology". This helps orientation, especially when navigating between views. Should include:
- Dynamic breadcrumb based on current view and context
- Clickable segments for navigation
- Truncation for long paths with hover expansion
- Subtle styling that doesn't compete with content

## Task 3: Things 3 today badge pulse animation
Add a subtle pulse animation to the Today count badge in the sidebar when there are due cards (due > 0). This draws attention without being obnoxious. Should include:
- Gentle pulse animation (scale 1.0 to 1.05, opacity variation)
- Only activates when due count > 0
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion
- Stops pulsing after user views Today or completes review session
