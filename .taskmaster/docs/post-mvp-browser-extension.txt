# Post-MVP: Browser Extension for Web Capture

## Overview
Create a browser extension (Chrome/Firefox) that allows users to capture content directly from web pages into DougHub's Knowledge Bank.

## Features
- Right-click context menu to capture selected text
- Capture entire page or selection
- Auto-extract metadata (URL, title, date)
- Quick tag assignment before capture
- Visual feedback confirming capture success
- Support for capturing images alongside text
- Integration with DougHub via local HTTP API or native messaging

## Technical Approaches

### Option A: Tampermonkey Script (Simpler)
- User installs Tampermonkey
- DougHub provides a userscript
- Script communicates with DougHub via localhost API
- Lower barrier to entry for technical users

### Option B: Native Browser Extension (Better UX)
- Full Chrome/Firefox extension
- Native messaging with Electron app
- Better permissions handling
- Publishable to extension stores

## Implementation Notes
- DougHub needs to expose a local HTTP API (e.g., localhost:31337)
- API endpoint: POST /api/capture with {content, url, title, sourceType: 'webcapture'}
- Extension should queue captures if DougHub is not running
- Consider offline support with sync when app opens

## User Flow
1. User browses UWorld, UpToDate, or any medical resource
2. Selects relevant text
3. Right-click → "Send to DougHub"
4. Optional: Quick tag assignment popup
5. Content appears in DougHub Inbox as SourceItem

## Dependencies
- Requires Layer 1 (Knowledge Bank) to be complete
- Requires local API server in Electron main process
