# Post-MVP Search Enhancements

These are deferred features to consider after MVP launch.

## Task: OCR Image Text Search
Extract text from images for searchability. Requires Tesseract.js or Cloud OCR API integration. Index extracted text in FTS5 for search. High complexity. Status: deferred.

## Task: Video Transcription Search
Transcribe video/audio content using Whisper for searchability. Very high complexity. Major scope consideration. Status: deferred.

## Task: Voice Search (Siri-like)
Implement voice-to-text search using Web Speech API. Allow users to speak search queries instead of typing. High complexity. Status: deferred.

## Task: Semantic Intent Search
Use AI embeddings to understand search intent beyond keyword matching. Could leverage Ollama for local embeddings. Medium complexity. Status: deferred.

## Task: Context-aware Search Suggestions
AI-powered suggestions like "Cards comparing X and Y" based on user context and study patterns. Needs AI inference. Medium complexity. Status: deferred.
