TITLE: Queue onboarding and guidance: explain what Queue is and how to access reviews

DESCRIPTION: Users don't understand what the Queue view is or how it relates to reviews. Add onboarding explanation and UI guidance.

DETAILS:
PROBLEM:
- No clear explanation of Queue vs Review
- Users don't know where to find due cards
- Terminology confusion: 'Queue' is vague
- No guidance on what to do when queue is empty

SOLUTION:
1. First-time Queue visit: Show tutorial modal explaining:
   - Queue shows cards due for review today
   - Auto-populated by FSRS scheduler
   - Click 'Start Review' to begin session
   - Visual diagram: Capture → Cards → Queue → Review

2. Empty state guidance:
   - When queue empty: 'No cards due. Next review: [timestamp]'
   - Suggest: 'Create more cards' or 'Adjust daily limit in Settings'
   - Show upcoming review schedule (next 7 days)
   - Link to Capture view to create more cards

3. Header/navigation clarity:
   - Consider renaming 'Queue' to 'Due Cards' or 'Review Queue'
   - Add badge with due count in sidebar/header
   - Tooltip on hover: 'Cards scheduled for review today'

4. Contextual help:
   - Small '?' icon in Queue header
   - Clicking shows: queue logic, scheduling explanation
   - Link to Review to start session

5. Visual improvements:
   - Show preview of next 3-5 cards in queue
   - Display estimated time to complete queue
   - Show progress: "5 of 23 cards reviewed today"

FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY:
- src/components/review/QueueView.tsx (create or update)
- src/components/modals/QueueTutorialModal.tsx
- src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx (badge + tooltip)
- src/stores/useAppStore.ts (track tutorial completion)
