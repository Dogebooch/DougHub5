# User Profile - Enhanced with Flashcard Research Insights

## Identity
- **Name:** Doug
- **Role:** IM/EM resident with ADHD studying for licensing boards in internal medicine and emergency medicine
- **One-liner:** Doug is a resident who craves systematic learning but drowns in the organizational overhead of making his tools work together, especially when cognitively depleted post-shift.

## Context
- **When:** Days off, post-shift, or between clinical responsibilities (3-4 hour windows, 1-2 hours usable focus)
- **Where:** Desktop at home exclusively for MVP (mobile capture deferred to post-MVP)
- **State:** Decision-fatigued, mentally exhausted post-shift, zero tolerance for admin work or scheduling decisions

## Goals & Motivations
- Pass IM/EM licensing boards with strong clinical reasoning (target: high performance on practice questions)
- Build durable medical knowledge through evidence-based spaced repetition
- Apply knowledge at bedside (generates excitement and momentum for studying)
- Reduce daily flashcard time from 3+ hours to 1-2 hours while improving retention
- One canonical, trusted source for all medical knowledge
- **Achieve 20-30% study efficiency improvement through evidence-based FSRS scheduling**

## Medical Education Context & Learning Preferences
- **Current workflow:** Sketchy Medicine videos → Tier Prep/Mix App 19 practice questions → Fragmented capture across multiple tools
- **Content types:** Differential diagnoses, pharmacology, pathophysiology, clinical reasoning
- **Learning challenges:** Medical lists (differentials) create sibling contamination; needs clinical context conversion to bedside scenarios
- **Study materials:** Tier Prep and Mix App 19 (practice board questions), UWorld, AMBOSS, medical textbooks, Sketchy videos
- **Time pressure:** Limited study windows between shifts, competing clinical responsibilities
- **Clinical reasoning priority:** Prefers "why" questions over "what" questions - wants pathophysiology understanding over rote memorization
- **Board prep strategy:** Needs USMLE-format clinical vignettes over basic fact recall
- **Medical domain focus:** Wants cards that transfer to actual patient care, not just exam performance

## Frustrations & Pain Points
- **Decision paralysis:** Loses 10+ minutes per session on "Where does this go?" and "Is this a duplicate?"
- **Tool fragmentation:** Can't find cards when needed, can't update related cards together
- **Anki limitations:** Browser is unintuitive, no clinical context for medical lists, manual scheduling decisions
- **Scheduling complexity:** Zero tolerance for Easy/Medium/Hard grading decisions or interval adjustments
- **Anxiety triggers:** Missing duplicates, overlooked unedited cards, scattered information across tools
- **Context switching:** Tool switching loses momentum when finding things takes time
- **Pattern-matching cards:** Frustrated by cards that test recognition of format rather than actual medical knowledge
- **List contamination:** Hates when reviewing one missed differential reveals all other answers

## Technical Comfort
- **Comfortable with:** Keyboard shortcuts, desktop apps, Anki (despite frustrations), medical software workflows
- **Uncomfortable with:** Complex configuration, CLI tools, debugging, manual validation steps
- **Critical requirement:** Auto-validation of all setup steps—Doug dives in immediately without checking if things work
- **Error handling:** Needs hard stops and obvious error messages, never silent failures

## Behavioral Patterns
- **Learning style:** Groups by clinical contrast (HOCM vs Aortic Stenosis), uses Sketchy as organizational anchor
- **Work patterns:** Dives in immediately, hates reading documentation, forgets available features
- **Decision making:** Prefers automation over choices, craves objective/transparent reasoning
- **Session patterns:** 3-4 hour windows with 1-2 hours usable focus, several hours between sessions
- **Frustration response:** Closes app and takes break when tool becomes friction source

## AI Interaction & Data Collection Preferences
- **AI assistance attitude:** Welcomes AI suggestions but wants to review each individually (no batch-approve)
- **Data collection comfort:** Comfortable with **silent performance tracking** for personalization (response times, domains, accuracy) as long as:
  - Happens transparently without user intervention
  - Directly improves his study experience (better scheduling, fewer reviews)
  - No additional configuration or privacy decisions required
- **AI transparency:** Wants to see reasoning for AI decisions (why this format? why this connection?)
- **Error tolerance:** Wrong AI suggestions are very annoying—prioritize accuracy over speed
- **AI scope:** AI should follow evidence-based flashcard practices, not invent approaches
- **Card quality expectations:** AI must enforce minimum information principle (one concept per card)
- **Medical accuracy:** AI must understand medical terminology and create clinically accurate scenarios

## FSRS Scheduling Preferences & Evidence-Based Learning
- **Current pain:** Anki's SM-2 requires daily grading decisions (Easy/Good/Hard/Again)
- **Desired solution:** Complete automation of review scheduling with no user decisions
- **Tolerance for complexity:** Zero—FSRS should work silently in background
- **Performance expectation:** 20-30% reduction in daily review time while maintaining >85% retention
- **Customization attitude:** No manual parameter tuning—wants research-based defaults that work
- **Trust requirement:** Must see evidence-based justification for algorithm choice
- **Medical optimization:** Wants domain-specific scheduling (cardiology vs pharmacology) but happening automatically
- **Response time sensitivity:** Comfortable with system tracking response speed for personalized intervals

## UX Requirements & Performance Expectations
- **Speed requirements:** <20 seconds capture time, <200ms search response, <500ms save confirmations
- **Click economy:** ≤2 clicks maximum for any core workflow
- **Decision elimination:** Zero organizational choices during capture (AI suggests, user confirms)
- **Visual design:** Simple, medium-dark, neutral earthy tones (reduces post-shift visual fatigue)
- **Workflow guidance:** Hard stops, greyed-out elements, tooltips—naturally draws eye to next action
- **Error recovery:** Auto-save, persistent sessions, undo for all actions, crash recovery
- **Card quality feedback:** Real-time warnings for pattern-matching cards or minimum information violations

## Review vs Capture Mental States

| Aspect | Capture Mode | Review Mode |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Mental State** | Learning, curious, building understanding | Task completion, getting through queue |
| **Patience Level** | High—wants perfection and deep connections | Low—zero tolerance for editing/admin |
| **Primary Goal** | Understand concepts, create perfect cards | Complete daily reviews efficiently |
| **AI Interaction** | Welcomes suggestions and improvements | Wants zero interruptions or decisions |
| **Connection Making** | Actively seeks related concepts and links | Light connection awareness only |
| **Time Tolerance** | Will spend time getting extraction right | Wants to finish reviews quickly |
| **Card Quality Focus** | Wants evidence-based, clinically accurate cards | Focuses on recall performance, not card editing |

## Performance Data Collection Requirements (Silent & Automatic)
- **Response time tracking:** Per card, per domain, per session (for FSRS interval optimization)
- **Accuracy tracking:** Partial credit on lists, success rates by medical specialty
- **Usage patterns:** Peak performance times, session length optimization
- **Content analysis:** Which medical domains need different scheduling approaches
- **Error patterns:** Common failure points for improved AI suggestions
- **Clinical reasoning tracking:** Performance on "why" vs "what" question types
- **All data collection:** Must happen silently without user decisions or notifications

## Core Conflict
Doug needs systematic structure to retain medical knowledge long-term, but organizational structure creates the exact decision points that prevent him from starting study sessions when cognitively depleted. Additionally, he needs clinical reasoning skills for boards and bedside care, but traditional flashcards often test rote memorization instead of understanding.

## Job Statements
1. **Primary:** "When I'm reviewing Tier Prep and Mix App 19 questions and identify key medical concepts, I want to capture and connect them without deciding where they go or how they're formatted, so that I can build clinical reasoning instead of managing tools."

2. **Exhaustion escape:** "When I encounter important medical information but I'm too tired to process it properly, I want to save it quickly without any decisions, so that I can deal with it when I'm mentally fresh."

3. **Review efficiency:** "When I'm reviewing flashcards, I want zero scheduling decisions so that I can focus entirely on medical content without cognitive overhead about tools, while getting the 20-30% efficiency improvement that evidence-based scheduling provides."

## Success Validation
- **Primary indicator:** Doug uses this app daily instead of his current fragmented workflow
- **Failure signal:** If decision paralysis returns or he abandons the app, the design has failed
- **Trust metric:** Doug stops worrying about data loss and completely relies on the app
- **Performance metric:** Achieves 20-30% reduction in review time while improving medical knowledge retention
- **Clinical reasoning metric:** Medical lists become clinical scenarios that improve bedside application
- **Board preparation metric:** Practice question accuracy improves toward 76%+ target
