TITLE: Statistics and analytics dashboard (FSRS metrics, retention, weak topics)

DESCRIPTION: Comprehensive analytics view showing learning progress, FSRS metrics, retention curves, and performance insights.

DETAILS:
MEDICAL RESIDENT NEEDS:
- "Am I actually retaining this?" - Confidence in learning
- "What are my weak areas?" - Targeted review
- "How much do I know about X?" - Topic mastery
- "Am I ready for boards?" - Exam readiness metrics

DASHBOARD SECTIONS:

1. OVERVIEW STATS (top cards):
   - Total cards: Active / Mature / New
   - Cards reviewed today / this week / all time
   - Average retention rate (%)
   - Study streak (days)
   - Estimated time to clear queue

2. RETENTION CURVE:
   - Line graph: Retention % over time (30/60/90 days)
   - FSRS model accuracy indicator
   - Compare: Predicted vs actual retention
   - Visual: Green = good retention, Yellow = borderline, Red = concerning

3. TOPIC BREAKDOWN:
   - Horizontal bar chart: Cards per topic
   - Color-coded by mastery level (New/Learning/Mature)
   - Click topic → drill down to card list
   - Weak topics highlighted (low ease, high lapse rate)

4. REVIEW HEATMAP:
   - Calendar heatmap (GitHub-style): Review activity by day
   - Hover shows: X cards reviewed, Y minutes studied
   - Identify patterns: study consistency, gaps

5. FSRS INSIGHTS:
   - Average ease by topic
   - Hardest cards (lowest ease, most lapses)
   - Cards at risk (due soon, historically difficult)
   - Personalized difficulty estimate

6. PERFORMANCE TRENDS:
   - Response time trends (faster = better retention)
   - Auto-grade distribution (Again/Hard/Good/Easy %)
   - Learning velocity: New cards → Mature over time
   - Forecast: "At current pace, X cards mature/month"

7. STUDY GOALS & MILESTONES:
   - "100-day streak" achievement
   - "1000 mature cards" milestone
   - "90% retention maintained" badge
   - Progress toward user-set goals

UI/UX:
- Accessible via sidebar: "Stats" icon (📊)
- Responsive grid layout: 2-3 columns on desktop, stack on mobile
- Export data: CSV download for external analysis
- Date range filter: Last 7/30/90/365 days or All Time
- Print-friendly view for mentors/program directors

CHARTS LIBRARY:
- Recharts or Chart.js for React
- Lightweight, responsive, accessible

FILES TO CREATE:
- src/components/stats/StatsDashboard.tsx
- src/components/stats/RetentionCurve.tsx
- src/components/stats/TopicBreakdown.tsx
- src/components/stats/ReviewHeatmap.tsx
- src/components/stats/PerformanceTrends.tsx
- electron/stats-queries.ts: Aggregate queries for dashboard
- src/hooks/useStats.ts: Data fetching hook

DATABASE QUERIES:
- Aggregate review_logs by date, rating, topic
- Calculate retention: (Good+Easy) / Total reviews
- FSRS parameters per card/topic
- Response time averages
- Lapse rates per topic

EDGE CASES:
- New user with no data: Show placeholder "Start reviewing to see stats"
- Large datasets (100k+ reviews): Paginate or aggregate server-side
- FSRS model not trained yet: Show "Gathering data..." message
